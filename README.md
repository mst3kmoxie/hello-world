# hello-world
First test repository for FreeCodeCamp.

Even README introductions make me feel like the new kid on the first day of school.  Dig my saddleshoes. Awkward.

I'm a 15-going-on-50 apprentice programmer who loves Doctor Who, Mystery Science Theatre 3000, and everything that goes with the greater SciFi culture. Oh, and cats.  Of course cats.  I read mostly humour and/or nonfiction, and love everything that Richard Ayoade chooses to be.

My career goals include being able to finally get paid for doing something I love, and ultimately building a gaming empire with my kids once they get out of university.  :-)

I'm NOT a hipster, but the odds are very high that I was already on-line before you were even born.
